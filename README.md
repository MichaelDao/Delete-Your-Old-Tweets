# Yeet-The-Tweet
I have too many embaressing old tweets I don't want to see anymore.

So I modified a python script from Quincy Larson.

## how to use this
You can follow this tutorial [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-delete-your-past-tweets-in-bulk-and-for-free-save-yourself-from-your-past-self-f8844cdbda2)

Simply put, I downloaded my twitter archive straight from my twitter settings, found the consumer keys from twitter developer and combined everything together to automatically delete all my tweets from a certain date.
